    "text": "Goal Details\n\nMotivation:\nFor this project we wanted to showcase our data visualization skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. For the purposes of demonstration we won’t use an actual real-time data as we found that there would be unwanted associated costs, so we will instead use a large historical dataset where our back-end server will automatically update the data table for the front-end at regular intervals, essentially mocking a live match.\n\n\nDescription of datasets:\nWe’ll use two datasets:\n\nODI_Match_Data.csv: Provides facts about the location and season of the cricket matches along with team information and the play results from each team member. We’ll need this one to investigate partnerships between batsmen. It’s dimensions are 155432 rows of data by 23 variable columns\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmatch_id\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each ODI cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\nstart_date\ncharacter\nThe date on which the match started.\n\n\ninnings\ndouble\nThe innings number (1st innings or 2nd innings).\n\n\nball\ndouble\nA numeric representation of the ball number bowled in the innings.\n\n\nbatting_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the batting team for the current innings.\n\n\nbowling_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the bowling team for the current innings.\n\n\nstriker\ncharacter\nThe batsman who is currently facing the ball.\n\n\nnon_striker\ncharacter\nThe batsman at the non-striker’s end.\n\n\nbowler\ncharacter\nThe bowler who is delivering the ball.\n\n\nruns_off_bat\ndouble\nThe number of runs scored off the bat (excluding extras).\n\n\nextras\ndouble\nThe total number of extra runs (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, penalty) in the current ball.\n\n\nwides\ndouble\nThe number of wide deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nnoballs\ndouble\nThe number of no-ball deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nbyes\ndouble\nThe number of byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\nlegbyes\ndouble\nThe number of leg-byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\n\nODI_Match_info.csv: Overlaps in data with the above but provides information on the umpire, performance, and the city the match took place. We’ll need this one to analyze the batting and bowling performance of each player. It’s dimensions are 2380 rows of data by 18 variable columns.\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\ndate\ndate\nThe date on which the match was played.\n\n\nteam1\ncharacter\nThe name of the first cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nteam2\ncharacter\nThe name of the second cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nresult\ncharacter\nThe result of the match (e.g., “normal,” “tie,” “no result”).\n\n\nwinner\ncharacter\nThe winning team of the match.\n\n\nwin_by_runs\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in runs (0 for wickets, if not applicable).\n\n\nwin_by_wickets\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in wickets (0 for runs, if not applicable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch questions :\nBelow we have the questions we would like to answer with our dashboard along with what we will need to answer them including variables, plot representations, and insights we can extract from the visuals.\n\nHow did the (a) scoring rate, (b) player batting performances, and (c) bowlers’ economy rates, evolve throughout the match?\nWe chose this question because it encompasses critical aspects of a cricket match, including scoring dynamics, standout individual performances, bowling efficiency, partnerships’ influence on runs, and overall player contributions, providing a holistic view of the match progression.\na. Scorecard summary:\nVariables: Overs (X-axis), Runs Scored per Over (Y-axis) - from ODI_Match_info.csv\nPlot Representation: Line chart or bar chart\nInsights: Visualize the scoring rate throughout the innings, show periods of acceleration or deceleration in runs scored.\nb. Batting Performance:\nVariables: Batsman Name (X-axis), Runs Scored (Y-axis) - from ODI_Match_info.csv\nPlot Representation: Bar chart or stacked bar chart\nInsights: Compares runs scored by each batsman, highlighting top performers.\nFor data wrangling: season, batsman, runs scored..\nc. Bowler’s economy rates:\nVariables: Bowler Name (X-axis), Economy Rate (Y-axis)\nPlot Representation: Box plot or violin plot\nInsights: Shows the distribution of economy rates among bowlers, indicating variations in performance.\nHow did (a) partnerships influence total runs, and (b) what insights do team performances, player contributions and live updates provide about the match dynamics?\nWe selected this question to highlight the significance of partnerships in contributing to total runs, while also delving into team performances and individual player contributions, offering insights into strategic game play and the match’s overall dynamics.\na. Partnerships Overview:\nVariables: Batsman Pair (X-axis), Partnership Runs (Y-axis)\nPlot Representation: Network graph or line chart\nInsights: Highlights significant partnerships and their impact on total runs.\nb.\n\nPlayer Comparison (merged from other questions):\nVariables: Player Name (X-axis), Batting/Bowling Statistics (Y-axis)\nPlot Representation: Radar chart or spider chart\nInsights: Provides a comprehensive comparison of players’ performances across multiple metrics.\nTeam Comparison (merged from other questions):\nVariables: Team Name (X-axis), Runs Scored/Wickets Taken (Y-axis)\nPlot Representation: Pie chart or half-eye plot\nInsights: Visualizes the proportion of runs scored or wickets taken by each team, offering a quick comparison view.\nDynamic Updates (merged from other questions):\nVariables: Live Data (e.g., Score, Commentary, Player Stats)\nPlot Representation: Live dashboard with real-time updates\nInsights: Access to latest match information for enhanced engagement.\n\n\nThe data visualization methods are subject to change while we analyze the data."

We’ll then process the data to calculate runs per over, total runs by each batsman, and economy rates for bowlers, adjusting for factors like incomplete overs. Visualizations will be crafted to display these metrics effectively: scoring rates will be shown via line or bar charts, batting performances through bar charts, and bowlers’ economy rates with box or violin plots.
