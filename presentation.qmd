## Introduction {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
This project aims to create a dashboard for a live cricket match using historical data and API mock-ups. The motivation stems from showcasing data visualization skills within the context of a dynamic, real-time data-set, albeit simulated through historical data updates.
:::

## Objective {auto-animate="true"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
-   

-   **Question 1**: How did the scoring rate, player batting performances, and bowlers' economy rates evolve throughout the match?

-   **Question 2**: How did partnerships influence total runs, and what insights do team performances, player contributions, and live updates provide about the match dynamics?

### Plot1

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   For season 2022/23,the donut chart illustrates the distribution of total runs scored by different countries, represented as percentages of the total runs scored worldwide.

-   The largest segment with 13.5% indicates the country that contributed the most to the global total, highlighting its dominant performance in that season.

-   Smaller segments represent other countries' contributions, with varying degrees of impact on the total runs scored, showing a diverse range of performances across different cricket-playing nations.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
### Plot2

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   The graphs compare the batting performances of cricketers RD Gaikwad and KL Rahul over multiple seasons.

-   RD Gaikwad shows a sharp increase in runs in the 2023/24 season, indicating a significant improvement, while KL Rahul displays more variability with a peak in the 2020/21 season.

-   These visualizations help us assess player progression and form, offering insights valuable for team management and strategy development.

::: {.column width="30%"}
### Plot3

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   The dashboard compares the performances of two bowlers. Let's consider an example of two bowlers Mohammed Shami and A Zampa.

-   The plot shows that shami's wickets have peaked during the 2019/20 season but showed a significant decline in the following seasons, suggesting a drop in bowling effectiveness or fewer games played.

-   Zampa had his highest wicket totals in the early seasons shown, particularly in 2018/19 and 2019/20, with a gradual decline in the subsequent years, reflecting changes in his bowling impact or match participation.
