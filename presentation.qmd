# Introduction

This project aims to create a dashboard for a live cricket match using historical data and API mock-ups. The motivation stems from showcasing data visualization skills within the context of a dynamic, real-time dataset, albeit simulated through historical data updates.

## **Research Questions**

-   How did the scoring rate, player batting performances, and bowlers' economy rates evolve throughout the match?

    ###### 

-   How did partnerships influence total runs, and what insights do team performances, player contributions, and live updates provide about the match dynamics?

## Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Plots

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
