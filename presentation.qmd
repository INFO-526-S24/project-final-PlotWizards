## **Introduction**

-   Our project's goal is to create a dynamic dashboard that simulates a live cricket match experience utilizing historical data.
-   The dashboard uses mocked live data updates to present vital insights into several areas of cricket matches and team dynamics.
-   The project uses automatic data refreshes and API-driven analytics to manage live dataset problems, improve comprehension of cricket trends, and showcase cost-effective real-time sports analytics.

## **Understanding the Data set**

-   Extracted data from the data-set "**ODI Men's Cricket Match Data (2002-2023)"** sourced from Kaggle.

-   From the original data-set we extracted two subsets:-

    -   Past Data : Contains data for 5 years from 2018-2022.

    -   Live Data: Contains data for the year 2023 till date.

-   The data-set includes match details, innings data, player performance, match outcome, and umpire details.

## **Question 1:**

What is the performance of top 10 Batsmen?

A. Scoring evolution over the match and top 10 batsman for each match?

B. Top 10 batting percentage for each year?

## **Question 2:**

How do the running scores differ by countries over the years?

A. The Total runs scored by each country?

B. The runs scores by different countries over the years?

#### Insights {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   The "Scoring Rate Evolution" graph shows the number of runs provided to the opponent per over throughout two different innings of a cricket match.
-   The red line shows the scoring rate in the first innings, while the blue line indicates the scoring rate in the second innings.
-   The graphic indicates that both innings have variable scoring rates, with many peaks indicating overs with very high scoring.

#### Insights {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   The map illustrate the total runs scored by countries in the 2022/23 cricket season, using a color gradient to represent the data.
-   The color scale ranges from light yellow (1000 runs) to dark blue (2000 runs), indicating the volume of runs scored.

#### Insights {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   The Donut chart represents the percentage distribution of total cricket runs scored by different teams in the 2022/23 season.
-   This visualization highlights the dominance of the leading team in run-scoring compared to the others in different seasons.

#### Insights

-   This bar chart represents the top 10 batting partnerships in terms of runs scored during the 2022/23 cricket season.
-   Each pair of batsmen is represented by a different color and labeled under the chart.
-   The chart effectively shows the variability and success of different batting combinations in contributing significant runs to their teams' totals.

## **Conclusion**

-   Our project demonstrated the successful integration of data visualization tools and APIs to simulate a live cricket match experience.\
-   Through rigorous data analysis, we provided deep insights into scoring rates, batting and bowling performances, and the strategic impacts of partnerships.\
-   By mimicking live data updates, our project delivered a cost-effective yet realistic approach to sports analytics.
